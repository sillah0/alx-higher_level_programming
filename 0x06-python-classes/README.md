Python - Classes and Objects

In Python, classes and objects are fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP)

Classes:
A class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines a data structure along with methods that operate on the data. You can think of a class as a user-defined data type.

Objects:
An object is an instance of a class. It is a concrete realization of the blueprint defined by the class. Objects have attributes (characteristics) and methods (actions) associated with them.
